# TO DO
1 - Package it

2 - Unit test

3 - Docstring and type inference

4 - Docker 

5 - Improve algo performance :
  - hyperparameter tuning of HOG opencv implementation
  - implement non-maxima suppression
  - implement a deep learning solution (use transfer learning)
  - test with only human faces detection ?

6 - Implement Github CI Actions
